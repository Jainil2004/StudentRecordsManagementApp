# StudentRecordsManagementApp
In this project, I have depicted the use of OOPs in Java and the various features it offers.

v1.0.0-alpha (Aug 24th, 2023): 
1. NEW : added the main program (StudentManagementApp.java) to the repo.
2. The program is yet not capable of doing anything other then read the test input.


v1.0.0-alpha1 (Aug 26th, 2023):
1. NEW : added the Student Class to the repo.
2. NEW : The Class provides the main Structure of the Project by effectively offering various methods for data abstraction and Storage.
3. main methods in the class -
   1. Constructor (for initializing the objects of the class)
   2. setGrades (allowing the user to input the grades in the courses enrolled by the user)
   3. calculateGPA (for calculation of SGPA using the data provided through the setGrades method)
   4. displayInfo (to display the SAPID, Student Name and the SGPA)
   5. enrolledCourses (for enrolling the Student in a specific course)
   6. listCourses (to display all the courses the Student is enrolled in)
4. UPDATED : Changed the Main program to accomodate the changes.
for better understanding of all the methods and how they work. please check out the code where I've made comments
explaining in brief the functioning of all the different methods mentioned above.
